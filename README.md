#MASKVISION (SERVELLENCE SYSTEM)
The AI Mask Detection project aims to develop a real-time system to automatically detect whether individuals in a given video feed or image are wearing face masks. This technology is particularly useful in public spaces like airports, shopping malls, offices, and schools to ensure compliance with health and safety guidelines.
